# Stevie's Static Site

## `I enjoy simplicity over much everything else..`

This is the first website I make for myself.

I built it from first principles.

It's a single HTML page with a sprinkle of CSS and jQuery.

I followed Material Design patterns with my own little twist.

For a long time I thought about what I wanted to create as my personal site.

I desired for whatever I built to be a representation of my true self..

This is `MY` website.

And it is simple.

And I am proud of it.

I enjoy simple things.

One day I'm sure I'll add fancy things.

One day I'll make it dynamic.

One day I'll break this all down and build it back up using React or some other framework.

But for now, I am happy with it.

I'll be honest, I couldn't get a lot of things to line up just how I wanted.

And I couldn't get my elephant .svg to render properly on mobile.

It's a never-ending work in progress..

`Just as I am.`

Thank you.

I'm great at absorbing criticisms.

If there's any way you wish to help me improve,

Please don't hesitate.

One ❤️.

## About The Elephants

Dumbo was my favorite movie as a child.

His is the story of an elephant who is tormentend because his physical appearance is a bit different than the rest.

By the end of the story though, Dumbo has won over everyone's hearts.

Elephants are smart and show great emotional intelligence in the face of adversity.

I like to think there's little elephant in each of us.

We gotta help them ..

## About Me

The most important thing you should know about me is that I looveee pistachios. My fondness for elephants ranks a distant second when placed up against those green little tasty treats. Only after my love for pistachios has been exhausted does my love for elephants begin to manifest itself.

I am a first generation American. So I am learning a lot along the way. In the 1970’s my mom and dad emigrated here from a very humble part of Colombia. They came to the U.S.A. for a better life. And they did it for me too. They are living their American dream, and I plan to do the same.

If I am ever in a position to help you, I will.

Stay Blessed

-Steven
